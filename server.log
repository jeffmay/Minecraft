2012-01-05 23:23:46 [INFO] <Jeffrow> ok, so, you need wheat
2012-01-05 23:23:58 [INFO] <Jeffrow> which you get seeds for by attacking grass
2012-01-05 23:24:10 [INFO] <Jeffrow> eventually, you will find some seeds
2012-01-05 23:24:17 [INFO] <Jeffrow> then you hoe some land
2012-01-05 23:24:22 [INFO] <anxiousmodernman> got seeds
2012-01-05 23:24:29 [INFO] <anxiousmodernman> i'll make a hoe
2012-01-05 23:24:38 [INFO] <Jeffrow> in a couple days you get wheat
2012-01-05 23:24:48 [INFO] <Jeffrow> then you harvest a crop of it
2012-01-05 23:25:01 [INFO] <Jeffrow> and each wheat can give you 0-3 seeds
2012-01-05 23:25:10 [INFO] <Jeffrow> so you continue to add seeds
2012-01-05 23:25:22 [INFO] <Jeffrow> they also need water to grow
2012-01-05 23:25:30 [INFO] <Jeffrow> otherwise they grow slowly or die
